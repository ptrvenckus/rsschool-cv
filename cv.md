## About me

I have studied Catholic Theology. When I was a student I was working as a journalist and translator. I like to learn foreign languages. My hobby is to write poems. I started to learn programming because it is interesting to me and it can help me better to express myself and may be to find some useful work.

## Skills

1. HTML5 basics
2. CSS3 basics
3. JavaScript basics
4. Git basics and GitHub 
5. Visual Studio Code
6. Figma basics
7. Bash (Shell) basics

## Code example

```
function greet() {
  let myName = "Petras";
  return `Hello! I am ${myName}.`;
}
```
## Work experience

I have very little work experience as a programmer. I have colaborated with programmers working in newspaper, but not in technical level. I can make webpage using html and css.
